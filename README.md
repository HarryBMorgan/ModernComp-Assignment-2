# ModernComp-Assignment-2

All code has been completed in Python.

This is the Git of my second coursework assignment for Modern Computational Techniques at University. The brief for each task is as follows:
1) Create a Neural Network that trains to reproduce a truth table. It has 3 input nodes and follows the logic of a not or gate (XOR). Use the Metropolis Algorithm to impliment the training rule. (A file is included to describe the choices of network geometry and implimentation of the Metropolis Algorithm.)
2) Create a programme that uses the fast fourier transform to calculate the coefficients of the fourier series of a discrete set of data. To check the coefficients are correct, generate the continous truncated fourier function and plot it against the origional data.
3) Use the Monte Carlo techniques to calcuate the "volume" of the unit n-ball for dimensions of 2 to 15. Plot the volumes against the dimensions.

I am a happy boy :)
